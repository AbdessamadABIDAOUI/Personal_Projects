# Personal_Projects
first personal project is a TicTacToe game.
The file TictacToe_Multi.py contains the game in multiplayer mode
The file TictacToe_vs_Bot contains the game played vs a bot that selects random choices
I'm working on making the bot Smart using machine learning and data science concepts (i don't wanna like force moves i want to create a model to learn from himself)



P.S: I still Haven't took any data science or machine learning Course Yet byt now this model is for me (an ambitious beginner with very little information about data science and machine learning) is like creating data science or machine learning from Zero.
    N.B: I just wanted to challenge myself this is gonna be literally my first model. I still wish to continue studiying and learning.
